# Capstone Project 1: Online Resume

## Overview
This is my first Capstone Project, an online resume built using pure HTML as part of a web development course. The project showcases my education, work experience, research, course projects, leadership activities, skills, and contact information in a structured and visually appealing format. The website is deployed on GitHub Pages for public access.

## Features
- **Semantic HTML Structure**: Utilizes HTML tags like `<h1>`, `<ul>`, `<table>`, and `<a>` for clear organization and navigation.
- **Multi-Section Resume**: Includes sections for Summary, Education, Work Experience, Research, Course Projects, Leadership & Extracurriculars, Skills & Certificates, Hobbies, and Contact.
- **Navigation Bar**: Anchor links (`<a href="#section">`) enable smooth navigation within the single-page website.
- **Profile Photo**: Displays a personal photo using the `<img>` tag.
- **Emoji Support**: Incorporates UTF-8 emojis for visual enhancement (e.g., ðŸ“š for Education, ðŸ’¼ for Work Experience).
- **Responsive Design**: Uses `<meta name="viewport">` for basic mobile compatibility.
- **GitHub Pages Deployment**: Hosted online for easy access.

   ```

2. Ensure the `profile.jpg` file is placed in the `assets/images/` directory.

3. Open `index.html` in a web browser by double-clicking the file or using a local server:

   ```

4. Verify that all sections, navigation links, and the profile photo display correctly.

## Deployment to GitHub Pages

## Notes

- The resume content is based on my academic and professional background, formatted for clarity and professionalism.
- Emojis are encoded in UTF-8 and should display correctly in modern browsers.
